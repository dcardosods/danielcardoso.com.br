DNAstack is an advanced platform for genomics data storage, bioinformatics, and sharing on the cloud.

I worked on this since the prototype phase, helped shape the project structure and UX. It's written in AngularJS consuming a REST API and has an extensive set of E2E tests using Cypress.

Recently I lead the efforts to upgrade the app to Angular 7 (I wrote about the first step at https://medium.com/@dcardosods/migrating-an-angularjs-apps-dependencies-from-bower-to-npm-ed474f44bd2) and helped to set up the app for CI/CD using Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes.
