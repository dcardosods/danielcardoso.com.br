I'm a Software Developer from Brazil, currently an exchange student at
[University of Waterloo][1] in Canada.

My expertise is in front-end developemt, i.e., all between a developer and a designer.
I'm interested in UX and accessibility research, configuration management and task
automation.

When away from a computer I practice sports, i.e., rock climbing lately, try to cook
healthy food and keep up with my friends.

You can find me on [Twitter][2], [Github][3] and [Linkedin][4].
Or send an [email][5].
