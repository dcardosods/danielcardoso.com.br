&lt;p&gt;I discovered this movement back in 2014 when I was an exchange student in Canada, and from there I started to dream about going nomadic myself. I started to research how I could use my skills to make money online, joined freelance platforms, and at the time I was decided to give a shot at creating custom WordPress themes. But circumstances changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I landed a great internship with a company in Toronto and luckily after this internship and my exchange in Canada completed, I was going back to back to Brazil with a full-time remote job. Cleary I dropped my initial plans–or better, I didn’t have to worry about how to make money online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back home, the urge to go nomadic remained, but I still had one and a half year of university to attend before graduating, so I had to wait before making the move. From time to time, on moments of procrastination or boredom, I’d started to frantically research about the digital nomad life and the destinations I’d like to travel to. Finally, two months before my graduation I made it real and bought flight tickets to Europe – Prague was going to be the beginning of my nomadic journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10 days after my graduation party I crossed the Atlantic for the first time and it all began. In that first season, I spent 5 months abroad, going back to Brazil in January 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2018 I took a flight to Europe again – season 2 began. It was much easier, I felt like a veteran, I knew how to do the “digital nomad” thing. I also knew that being constantly in the look for the new destination, planing all the logistics, saying goodbyes, etc, brings anxiety and gets tiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By that time, more than 3 years of working for the same company have passed, and even though I could make my schedule and fit it into my travels, the work was not motivating anymore and I wasn’t performing my best. Most of the other digital nomads whom I met were building their business projects, which gave them purpose and (arguably) more freedom. My feeling was that I was in it without passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Season 2 ended in December 2018, I was back in Brazil and after too much thought, I decided to quit my job – back to square one. I didn’t (and I don’t) see myself settling in Brazil for the time being, so my options were to keep on going nomadic, or find a job abroad and emigrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opted for the latter and my motivation was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being able to live in a country in Europe for more than 3 months. I guess I could apply for a “self-employed/freelancer” residence visa, but I’d need a business first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being closer to my girlfriend. Did I say that I met a girl in Europe and fell in love?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resuming my professional growth. I believe a change in the atmosphere, the people and the problems I work with will be beneficial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not an easy decision! After years of no commutes to work, flexible working hours, and full-time travel, the change would be huge. But here I am, settled and working in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can I say this is Season 3?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PS:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ironically, my first post on the topic of digital nomadism is about me going back to the “normal life”. But fear nothing, I have more draft articles on the subject and plan to publish them more often.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fluent Conference 2014 Complete Video Compilation By O‘Reilly Media, Inc; O‘Reilly Media.]]></title><description><![CDATA[This post is my first review for the O‘Reilly Blogger Review Program.

As part of that program I have free access to some O‘Reilly publications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video compilation of Fluent Conference show lots of Web authoring best practices, by well known people that are ruling the Web forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subjects are diverse. &lt;em&gt;HTML5, Javascript, CSS3, Web Components, MV* Web Frameworks (Angular, Ember), performance, team management, open source communities, etc.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Javascript is pointed as the &lt;strong&gt;Web’s assembler&lt;/strong&gt; and is the subject of several keynotes. Stating its history and how it’s evolving through its versions, addressing high and low level problems that allow us to build things from common web pages to complex 3d games or to do heavy mathematical operations.
&lt;em&gt;ES6&lt;/em&gt; is presented by some TC39 chairs among others. On that topic I highlight &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/guybedford&quot;&gt;Guy Bedford&lt;/a&gt; talk. He demonstrates a possible workflow to use the new module syntax and loaders right now, been able to compile into our current popular module systems (&lt;em&gt;AMD&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;CommonJS&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSS&lt;/strong&gt; is in the evolutionary path though, pushing the experience of browsing the Web to be much more enjoyable. It’s also very fun, and allow us to creatively experiment. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LeaVerou&quot;&gt;Lea Verou&lt;/a&gt; gives a talk about one single CSS property, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;border-radius&lt;/code&gt; showing unimaginable results and the promissory future of that property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance matters&lt;/strong&gt;. The goods to make pages more performatively and tips to avoid frustrating the user are very well covered. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Souders&quot;&gt;Steve Souders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/paul_irish&quot;&gt;Paul Irish&lt;/a&gt;, and some others talk about that subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a joke in the Javascript community that…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each day a new framework raise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true we have hundreds of framework choices, but today two of them reach a high level of adoption. &lt;em&gt;Angular&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ember&lt;/em&gt; are the subject of keynotes, talks and workshops. It seems that a kind of war happens between them, and as good and bad points of each are discussed during the Conference, after watch the videos you’ll have knowledge background to choose the one that better fits your necessities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ebidel&quot;&gt;Eric Bidelman&lt;/a&gt; is one who talks about &lt;strong&gt;Web Components&lt;/strong&gt;. Web Components is a set of new technologies that will change the way we build for the Web in the future. To use that in our current workflow we need some polyfills. &lt;em&gt;Polymer&lt;/em&gt; is one of these, and is much more that only a polyfill. It puts together a abstraction layer on the specification, a set of core elements and a UI style-guide, and has a drag/drop kind design tool for rapid prototypping. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mbleigh&quot;&gt;Michael Bleigh&lt;/a&gt; teaches Web Components in one of the event’s workshops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the material &lt;strong&gt;is not focused in beginners&lt;/strong&gt;, as it shows some advanced aspects of the Web technologies and new stuff that are in the near future path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the talks are available on &lt;em&gt;YouTube&lt;/em&gt;, so I recommend you check these and have a aperitif of how Fluent Conference 2014 was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PS:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I’ve not watched all the videos at the time I’m publishing the review. I’ll evolve this post if I find more interesting points about the content.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
