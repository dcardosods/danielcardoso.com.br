          <section class="content"><p>This post is my first review for the <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/reviews/index.csp">O‘Reilly Blogger Review Program</a>. As part of that program I have free access to some O‘Reilly&nbsp;publications.</p>
<p>The video compilation of Fluent Conference show lots of Web authoring best practices, by well known people that are ruling the Web&nbsp;forward.</p>
<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<p>The subjects are diverse. <em><span class="caps">HTML5</span>, Javascript, CSS3, Web Components, MV* Web Frameworks (Angular, Ember), performance, team management, open source communities,&nbsp;etc.</em></p>
<p>Javascript is pointed as the <strong>Web’s assembler</strong> and is the subject of several keynotes. Stating its history and how it’s evolving through its versions, addressing high and low level problems that allow us to build things from common web pages to complex 3d games or to do heavy mathematical operations.
<em><span class="caps">ES6</span></em> is presented by some <span class="caps">TC39</span> chairs among others. On that topic I highlight <a href="https://twitter.com/guybedford">Guy Bedford</a> talk. He demonstrates a possible workflow to use the new module syntax and loaders right now, been able to compile into our current popular module systems (<em><span class="caps">AMD</span></em> and <em>CommonJS</em>).</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">CSS</span></strong> is in the evolutionary path though, pushing the experience of browsing the Web to be much more enjoyable. It’s also very fun, and allow us to creatively experiment. <a href="https://twitter.com/LeaVerou">Lea Verou</a> gives a talk about one single <span class="caps">CSS</span> property, <code>border-radius</code> showing unimaginable results and the promissory future of that&nbsp;property.</p>
<p><strong>Performance matters</strong>. The goods to make pages more performatively and tips to avoid frustrating the user are very well covered. <a href="https://twitter.com/Souders">Steve Souders</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/paul_irish">Paul Irish</a>, and some others talk about that&nbsp;subject.</p>
<p>There is a joke in the Javascript community&nbsp;that…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each day a new framework&nbsp;raise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Its true we have hundreds of framework choices, but today two of them reach a high level of adoption. <em>Angular</em> and <em>Ember</em> are the subject of keynotes, talks and workshops. It seems that a kind of war happens between them, and as good and bad points of each are discussed during the Conference, after watch the videos you’ll have knowledge background to choose the one that better fits your&nbsp;necessities.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ebidel">Eric Bidelman</a> is one who talks about <strong>Web Components</strong>. Web Components is a set of new technologies that will change the way we build for the Web in the future. To use that in our current workflow we need some polyfills. <em>Polymer</em> is one of these, and is much more that only a polyfill. It puts together a abstraction layer on the specification, a set of core elements and a <span class="caps">UI</span> style-guide, and has a drag/drop kind design tool for rapid prototypping. <a href="https://twitter.com/mbleigh">Michael Bleigh</a> teaches Web Components in one of the event’s&nbsp;workshops.</p>
<p>To&nbsp;summarize:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the material <strong>is not focused in beginners</strong>, as it shows some advanced aspects of the Web technologies and new stuff that are in the near future&nbsp;path.</p>
<p>Some of the talks are available on <em>YouTube</em>, so I recommend you check these and have a aperitif of how Fluent Conference 2014&nbsp;was.</p>
